The document discusses testing an LLM's mathematical abilities by checking if the sum of odd numbers results in an even number, utilizing chain-of-thought prompting. An example prompt is provided: "The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 15, 32, 5, 13, 82, 7, 1. Solve by breaking the problem into steps. First, identify the odd numbers, add them, and indicate whether the result is odd or even." Additionally, it references a source on early experiments with GPT-4.
