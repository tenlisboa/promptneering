Meta Prompting is an advanced technique that emphasizes the structural and syntactical aspects of tasks when interacting with large language models (LLMs), prioritizing format and pattern over specific content. Key characteristics include being structure-oriented, syntax-focused, utilizing abstract examples, versatility across domains, and a categorical approach based on type theory. Unlike few-shot prompting, which is content-driven, meta prompting enhances token efficiency, allows for fair comparisons between problem-solving models, and can function effectively in zero-shot scenarios. It is particularly useful in complex reasoning tasks, mathematical problem-solving, coding challenges, and theoretical queries, although its effectiveness may decline with unique tasks. An example illustrating the difference between structured meta prompts and few-shot prompts is shown in the image provided.
