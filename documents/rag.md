Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method developed by Meta AI researchers to enhance language models for knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating an information retrieval component with a text generator. This approach allows models to access external knowledge sources, improving factual consistency and reducing "hallucination" in generated responses. RAG retrieves relevant documents, such as those from Wikipedia, which are then combined with the input prompt to produce outputs, making it adaptable to evolving facts without the need for retraining. The method has shown strong performance on benchmarks like Natural Questions and WebQuestions, generating more factual and diverse responses. A practical use case for RAG includes generating concise machine learning paper titles, demonstrating its potential in enhancing language model outputs.
