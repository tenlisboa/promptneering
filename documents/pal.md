The document discusses Program-Aided Language Models (PAL), introduced by Gao et al. (2022), which utilize large language models (LLMs) to interpret natural language problems and generate programs as intermediate reasoning steps, contrasting with traditional chain-of-thought prompting. An example is provided using LangChain and OpenAI GPT-3 to create an application that answers date-related questions by leveraging a Python interpreter. The necessary imports include `openai`, `datetime`, and `relativedelta`, followed by API configuration and model setup. A specific question is posed: "Today is 27 February 2023. I was born exactly 25 years ago. What is the date I was born in MM/DD/YYYY?" The prompt includes several date-related examples formatted in Python, and the LLM generates a code snippet that calculates the birth date. Executing this code snippet yields the output `02/27/1998`.
