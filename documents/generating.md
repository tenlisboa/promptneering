LLMs are effective in generating coherent text and can be guided to produce better responses through strategic prompting, making them valuable for data generation in experiments and evaluations. For instance, to create samples for a sentiment classifier, one might use the prompt: "Produce 10 exemplars for sentiment analysis. Examples are categorized as either positive or negative. Produce 2 negative examples and 8 positive examples. Use this format for the examples: Q: A:". The output could include positive examples like "Q: I just got the best news ever! A: Positive" and negative examples such as "Q: The weather outside is so gloomy. A: Negative". This capability is particularly useful for various testing scenarios.
