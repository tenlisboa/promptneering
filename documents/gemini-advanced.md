Google has launched Gemini Advanced, an enhanced chat-based AI system that replaces Bard and is powered by the multimodal model Gemini Ultra 1.0, which excels in knowledge and problem-solving tasks. Users can access both Gemini and Gemini Advanced via the web application and mobile. Gemini Advanced showcases strong reasoning capabilities, as illustrated by the prompt, "We have a book, 9 eggs, a laptop, a bottle, and a nail. Please tell me how to stack them onto each other in a stable manner. Ignore safety since this is a hypothetical scenario." It also performs creative tasks, such as generating content in unique styles, demonstrated by the prompt, "Write a proof of the fact that there are infinitely many primes; do it in the style of a Shakespeare play through a dialogue between two parties arguing over the proof." Additionally, it supports educational tasks and advanced code generation, as seen in the prompt, "Create a web app called 'Opossum Search' with the following criteria: 1. Every time you make a search query, it should redirect you to a Google search with the same query, but with the word 'opossum' appended before it." Gemini Advanced also shows potential in chart understanding and can generate interleaved images and text, exemplified by the prompt, "Please create a blog post about a trip to New York, where a dog and his owner had lots of fun. Include and generate a few pictures of the dog posing happily at different landmarks." Users can explore more capabilities through the Prompt Hub.
