Anthropic has introduced Claude 3, a new family of models consisting of Claude 3 Haiku, Claude 3 Sonnet, and Claude 3 Opus, with Opus being the most powerful, outperforming GPT-4 and other models on benchmarks like MMLU and HumanEval. Claude 3 excels in advanced reasoning, mathematics, data extraction, content creation, code generation, and multilingual support, with Opus achieving near-perfect recall on the Needle In A Haystack evaluation. The models support 200K context windows, extendable to 1M tokens for select customers, and demonstrate strong vision capabilities for processing images and charts. Notably, Claude 3 models exhibit improved understanding of requests, fewer refusals, and enhanced accuracy in factual question answering, while also producing structured outputs like JSON objects. Examples of performance include "Claude 3 Benchmarks" and "Claude 3 Vision Capabilities."
