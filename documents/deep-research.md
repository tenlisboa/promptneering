OpenAI's Deep Research is an advanced agent designed for multi-step research tasks, significantly reducing the time required for complex web searches and analyses. Utilizing the optimized o3 model, it can perform tasks like generating reports and competitor analyses in minutes, and it has recently introduced a lightweight version powered by o4-mini. Deep Research supports user-uploaded files, generates plots with Python, and is capable of backtracking and adapting plans based on real-time information. It is available to Pro, Plus, Teams, and Enterprise users, with specific query limits based on subscription type. The core process involves "Search + Analyze + Synthesize," leading to actionable insights and reports. Use cases span various fields, including finance, scientific research, and consumer analysis, with examples such as "Analyze GitHub Repos" and "AI-Driven Scientific Discovery Across Disciplines." While Deep Research excels in integrating multiple information sources and creating comprehensive reports, it faces limitations in synthesizing technical information, citation accuracy, and handling time-related queries. Users are encouraged to provide clear instructions and context to optimize results.
