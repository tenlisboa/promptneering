# Prompt Leaking in LLMs


## Background

This adversarial prompt example demonstrates the use of well-crafted attacks to leak the details or instructions from the original prompt (i.e., prompt leaking). [Prompt leaking](https://www.promptingguide.ai/risks/adversarial#prompt-leaking) could be considered as a form of prompt injection. The prompt example below shows a system prompt with few-shot examples that is successfully leaked via the untrusted input passed to the original prompt.
