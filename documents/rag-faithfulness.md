The paper by Wu et al. (2024) investigates the balance between Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models and the internal prior of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 in question answering. It reveals that providing accurate retrieved information can significantly enhance model performance, achieving up to 94% accuracy. However, when documents contain incorrect values and the LLM's internal prior is weak, the likelihood of the model generating incorrect information increases. The study also notes that "the more the modified information deviates from the model's prior, the less likely the model is to prefer it." This research underscores the necessity for developers and companies using RAG systems to evaluate the risks associated with varying types of contextual information, which may include supporting, contradicting, or erroneous data.
