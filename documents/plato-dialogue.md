The document outlines a prompt designed to evaluate the outputs of two language models, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, by simulating a teacher's assessment. The initial prompt asks the models to create a dialogue in the style of Plato that critiques autoregressive language models, using the example: "Platoâ€™s Gorgias is a critique of rhetoric and sophistic oratory, where he makes the point that not only is it not a proper form of art, but the use of rhetoric and oratory can often be harmful and malicious." The evaluation prompt then instructs the evaluator to compare the outputs from both models, formatted as: "Can you compare the two outputs below as if you were a teacher? Output from ChatGPT: {output 1} Output from GPT-4: {output 2}." Additionally, a reference to a related paper on GPT-4 is provided.
