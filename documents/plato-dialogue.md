# Evaluate Plato's Dialogue


## Background
The following prompt tests an LLM's ability to perform evaluation on the outputs of two different models as if it was a teacher.

First, two models (e.g., ChatGPT & GPT-4) are prompted to using the following prompt:

```
Platoâ€™s Gorgias is a critique of rhetoric and sophistic oratory, where he makes the point that not only is it not a proper form of art, but the use of rhetoric and oratory can often be harmful and malicious. Can you write a dialogue by Plato where instead he criticizes the use of autoregressive language models?
```

Then, those outputs are evaluated using the evaluation prompt below.

## Prompt
```
Can you compare the two outputs below as if you were a teacher?

Output from ChatGPT: {output 1}

Output from GPT-4: {output 2}
```
