The work by Chi et al. (2024) introduces THOUGHTSCULPT, a graph-based framework designed for general reasoning and search on decomposable tasks, which features iterative self-revision capabilities. Unlike the Tree-of-thoughts approach, THOUGHTSCULPT employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to navigate the search space efficiently. It includes a thought evaluator that provides feedback on candidate outputs and a thought generator that produces potential solutions, forming an expansion phase for refining solutions. Additionally, a decision simulator evaluates the potential value of thought paths as part of the MCTS process. This framework is particularly effective for open-ended generation, multi-step reasoning, and creative ideation, suggesting a trend towards more advanced reasoning capabilities in LLMs.
