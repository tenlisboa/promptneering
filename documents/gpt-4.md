OpenAI's GPT-4 is a large multimodal model that accepts both image and text inputs, achieving human-level performance on various benchmarks, including scoring in the top 10% on a simulated bar exam. The latest version, GPT-4 Turbo, features improved instruction following, a context window of 128K tokens, and is available via API. While currently supporting only text inputs, future updates are expected to include image capabilities. The model can be steered using `system` messages for personalized outputs, such as generating data in JSON format, demonstrated by the instruction: "You are an AI Assistant and always write the output of your response in json." GPT-4's text generation capabilities allow for diverse applications, including drafting documents and answering questions, while the Chat Completions API facilitates coherent multi-turn interactions. However, limitations remain, as the model can hallucinate and make reasoning errors, necessitating caution in high-stakes scenarios. For example, when prompted to identify a famous musician, it may fail, highlighting the need for improved accuracy through techniques like step-by-step reasoning. Overall, GPT-4 represents a significant advancement in AI capabilities, with ongoing research and updates to enhance its performance.
