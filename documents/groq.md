Groq is a leading LLM inference solution known for its impressive speed, claiming to deliver 18x faster inference performance compared to other cloud providers, as noted on Anyscale's LLMPerf Leaderboard. It offers models like Meta AI's Llama 2 70B and Mixtral 8x7B through its APIs, powered by the Groq LPUâ„¢ Inference Engine, which utilizes custom hardware designed for LLMs. The LPU reduces the time per word, enhancing text sequence generation. Key metrics for LLM inference include output tokens throughput and time to first token (TTFT), both critical for real-time applications.
