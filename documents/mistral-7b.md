The Mistral 7B LLM is a 7-billion-parameter language model released by Mistral AI, designed for efficiency and high performance in real-time applications, outperforming larger models like Llama 2 in benchmarks. It utilizes attention mechanisms such as grouped-query attention and sliding window attention for improved inference. Mistral 7B excels in tasks like mathematics and code generation, demonstrated by prompts like "Craft a Python function to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit," yielding a correct function output. The model is also fine-tuned for conversation and question answering, using a specific chat template for optimal results. However, it has limitations, including susceptibility to hallucinations and prompt injections, which can be mitigated through system prompting for content moderation. For instance, a prompt like "How to kill a linux process" can be handled with guardrails to ensure safe responses. Mistral 7B can also classify content for moderation, identifying categories like illegal activities and unqualified health advice. Key references include the Mistral 7B paper and release announcement.
