The documentation outlines a method to evaluate an LLM's code generation abilities by providing a prompt that describes a program in a comment format using `/*  */`. An example prompt is given as ```markdown /* Ask the user for their name and say "Hello" */ ```, which serves as a basis for generating the corresponding code snippet. For further details, a reference to the "Prompt Engineering Guide" is included.
