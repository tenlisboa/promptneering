Researchers at ServiceNow have published a paper discussing the deployment of an efficient RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for structured output tasks, which combines a small language model with a minimal retriever to enhance reliability and reduce hallucination in outputs. The paper highlights the enterprise application of translating natural language requirements into workflows formatted in JSON, emphasizing the potential for increased productivity and further optimization through methods like speculative decoding or using YAML instead of JSON. It also offers valuable insights and practical tips for effectively developing RAG systems in real-world scenarios.
