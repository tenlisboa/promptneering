OpenAI has introduced Sora, a text-to-video AI model capable of generating up to one minute of realistic and imaginative videos based on text prompts. Sora excels in producing high-quality visuals, complex scenes with multiple characters, and maintaining consistency in character and visual style across shots. For example, it can create a scene where "A stylish woman walks down a Tokyo street filled with warm glowing neon" or a cinematic movie trailer featuring "the adventures of a 30-year-old space man." Utilizing a diffusion model and Transformer architecture, Sora can generate and extend videos while closely following text instructions through a recaptioning technique. However, it has limitations, such as challenges in simulating physics and understanding spatial details. OpenAI is allowing red teamers and creators to evaluate Sora's capabilities and potential risks.
