The document discusses evaluating composite functions, specifically testing an LLM's mathematical capabilities. It presents a prompt where the function \( g(x) = f^{-1}(x) \) is defined with specific values: \( g(0) = 5 \), \( g(4) = 7 \), \( g(3) = 2 \), \( g(7) = 9 \), and \( g(9) = 6 \). The main question posed is to find \( f(f(f(6))) \).
