When working with LLMs via an API, several key settings can be adjusted to enhance the quality of responses. The **Temperature** setting influences randomness, with lower values yielding more deterministic results, suitable for fact-based tasks, while higher values encourage creativity, ideal for tasks like poem generation. **Top P** is a sampling technique that controls the diversity of responses; lower values yield more confident answers, while higher values allow for a broader range of outputs. It's recommended to adjust either temperature or Top P, but not both simultaneously. The **Max Length** parameter limits the number of tokens generated, helping to manage response length and costs. **Stop Sequences** can be used to halt generation at specific points, such as limiting lists to "11" items. The **Frequency Penalty** reduces the likelihood of repeated tokens based on their occurrence, while the **Presence Penalty** applies a uniform penalty to all repeated tokens, promoting diversity in responses. Similar to temperature and Top P, it's advisable to adjust either frequency or presence penalty, but not both. Results may vary depending on the LLM version used.
