The guide provides an overview of Gemini, Google's latest AI model with multimodal capabilities, designed for tasks involving text, images, video, audio, and code. Gemini is available in three sizes: "Ultra" for complex tasks, "Pro" for scaling across various tasks, and "Nano" for memory-constrained applications. It excels in 30 out of 32 benchmarks, achieving human-expert performance on the MMLU exam and demonstrating strong crossmodal reasoning. The models support a context length of 32k and are trained on diverse multimodal and multilingual data. Examples of Gemini's capabilities include text summarization, information extraction, visual question answering, and video understanding, with the model showing impressive performance in tasks like coding and instruction following. For instance, a summarization task yields the output: "Antibiotics are medicines used to kill or stop the growth of bacteria causing infections, but they don't work against viruses." Additionally, the guide includes a code example for using the Gemini API to perform information extraction tasks.
