The ReAct framework, introduced by Yao et al. in 2022, enables large language models (LLMs) to generate reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner, enhancing their ability to interact with external sources for more reliable responses. This approach combines reasoning and acting, allowing LLMs to dynamically adjust action plans while retrieving information from environments like Wikipedia. For example, a prompt from HotpotQA might be: ``"Aside from the Apple Remote, what other devices can control the program Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with?"``. The ReAct method has shown superior performance in knowledge-intensive tasks, outperforming traditional methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) in some areas, while also demonstrating effectiveness in decision-making tasks such as ALFWorld and WebShop. The framework can be implemented using LangChain, which integrates LLMs with various tools, as illustrated in a practical example where an agent retrieves information about Olivia Wilde's boyfriend and calculates his age raised to a power, yielding the final output: ``"Harry Styles, Olivia Wilde's boyfriend, is 29 years old and his age raised to the 0.23 power is 2.169459462491557."``.
