Google has introduced a new context-caching feature in the Gemini 1.5 Pro and Flash models, which allows for efficient querying of large datasets, exemplified by analyzing a year's worth of ML papers stored in a text file. The process involves preparing the data, uploading it via the Google `generativeai` library, and implementing context caching using the `caching.CachedContent.create()` function, where users specify the model, cache name, instructions, and a time-to-live (TTL). Users can then create a generative model instance and query it with natural language questions such as "Can you please tell me the latest AI papers of the week?" or "What are some of the innovations around long-context LLMs? List the title of the paper and summary." This method has shown promising results, enabling researchers to quickly analyze and retrieve specific findings without the need to resend the entire text file for each query, thus enhancing research efficiency. Further applications of context caching in complex scenarios are being explored.
