Self-consistency is an advanced prompt engineering technique proposed by Wang et al. (2022) that enhances chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting by sampling multiple reasoning paths to select the most consistent answer, particularly improving performance in arithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks. For example, when prompted with "When I was 6 my sister was half my age. Now Iâ€™m 70 how old is my sister?", the naive output is "35", which is incorrect. By applying self-consistency and using few-shot exemplars, multiple outputs can be generated, such as "When I was 6 my sister was half my age, so she was 3. Now I am 70, so she is 70 - 3 = 67. The answer is 67." This process reveals a majority answer, which can be taken as the final response, demonstrating the effectiveness of self-consistency in improving accuracy.
