The LLM Collection provides a summary of notable large language models (LLMs) with key details including their release dates, sizes, checkpoints, and descriptions. For instance, the "Falcon LLM," released in September 2023, features 180 billion parameters and was trained on 3500 billion tokens. The "Mistral-7B-v0.1," also from September 2023, is a generative text model with 7 billion parameters, utilizing a transformer architecture. Other models include "CodeLlama," designed for code synthesis, and "Llama-2," which offers foundational and dialog-fine-tuned models. The "Claude-2" model focuses on safety and versatility in conversational tasks, while "Tulu" is fine-tuned on various instruction datasets. Additionally, models like "ChatGLM2-6B" and "Nous-Hermes-13B" cater to bilingual tasks and instruction-following, respectively. The collection also highlights models like "GPT-3.5-turbo," optimized for chat, and "GPT-4," which showcases advanced capabilities. Each model is linked to its respective resources for further exploration.
