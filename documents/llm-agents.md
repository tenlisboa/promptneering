LLM agents, or large language model agents, are applications that utilize LLMs as the main controller to execute complex tasks by integrating modules like planning, memory, and tool usage. For instance, to answer a complex question about calorie intake trends and obesity rates in the U.S., an LLM agent would need to decompose the task into subtasks, access external knowledge bases, and utilize tools like a "code interpreter" for data visualization. The framework of an LLM agent typically includes components such as user requests, the LLM as the brain, planning for task decomposition, and memory for tracking past actions. Planning can be enhanced with feedback mechanisms like ReAct, which interleaves reasoning and acting. Memory is categorized into short-term and long-term types, aiding in dynamic reasoning. Tools enable interaction with external environments, and notable applications of LLM agents span various domains, including mental health support, scientific research, and software engineering. However, challenges remain, such as role adaptation, long-term planning, alignment with human values, and efficiency concerns.
