Function calling allows LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 to connect with external tools and APIs, enabling effective interaction and data retrieval. This capability is essential for developing LLM-powered chatbots that can convert natural language into API calls. For instance, a user query like ``"What is the weather like in London?"`` can trigger a function call to `get_current_weather`, which requires parameters such as location and unit. Developers can define functions in their API requests, and the model will return a JSON object with the necessary arguments. An example of a completion function is provided, which processes user messages and tools to generate a response. Function calling can be applied in various use cases, including creating conversational agents, natural language understanding, math problem solving, API integration, and information extraction.
