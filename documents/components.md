AI agents require three essential capabilities: planning, tool utilization, and memory management, to effectively handle complex tasks. Planning, driven by large language models (LLMs), involves task decomposition, self-reflection, adaptive learning, and critical analysis, which are vital for task completion. Tool utilization allows agents to interface with various external tools, such as code interpreters and web scraping utilities, enabling them to execute planned actions. Memory management consists of short-term memory for immediate context and long-term memory for historical information retrieval, facilitating iterative improvement. The interplay of these components is crucial for developing effective AI agents, and while they have limitations, they form the foundational architecture of AI systems.
