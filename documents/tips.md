When designing prompts, start simple and iterate to achieve optimal results, using platforms like OpenAI or Cohere for experimentation. Use clear instructions such as "Write", "Classify", or "Translate" at the beginning of your prompts, and consider separating instructions from context with a clear separator like "###". Specificity is crucial; detailed prompts yield better results, and including relevant examples can enhance output quality. Avoid impreciseness by being direct in your requests, as clearer prompts lead to more effective responses. Instead of stating what not to do, focus on what to do to guide the model effectively. For instance, a prompt like ```"Use 2-3 sentences to explain the concept of prompt engineering to a high school student."``` is more effective than vague instructions.
