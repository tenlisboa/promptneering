The document discusses the generation of synthetic datasets for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a method that combines information retrieval with text generation to enhance knowledge-intensive tasks, especially in scenarios with limited labeled data. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, it is now possible to quickly test ideas and develop AI features without extensive data collection. The key to RAG's effectiveness lies in a robust retrieval model that identifies relevant documents for processing. To generate domain-specific datasets, one can provide a short description and a few manually labeled examples, as different retrieval tasks have varying definitions of relevance. For instance, a prompt might look like: "Task: Identify a counter-argument for the given argument. Argument #1: {insert passage X1 here} A concise counter-argument query related to the argument #1: {insert manually prepared query Y1 here}". This approach allows for the creation of synthetic data that can significantly improve the performance of retrievers, particularly in specialized domains or low-resource languages, while being more cost-effective than traditional data collection methods.
