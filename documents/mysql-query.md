It includes a prompt example where the user specifies two tables, "departments" with columns [DepartmentId, DepartmentName] and "students" with columns [DepartmentId, StudentId, StudentName], and requests a MySQL query to retrieve all students in the Computer Science Department, formatted as ```"Create a MySQL query for all students in the Computer Science Department"```. Additionally, it references a Prompt Engineering Guide for further information.
