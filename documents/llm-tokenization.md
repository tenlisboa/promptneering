Andrej Karpathy's recent lecture on large language model (LLM) tokenization highlights its critical role in training LLMs, emphasizing that tokenizers are trained using specific datasets and algorithms like "Byte Pair Encoding." He demonstrates how to implement a GPT tokenizer from scratch and addresses various issues linked to tokenization, such as why LLMs struggle with spelling, simple string processing, non-English languages, arithmetic, and specific strings. Understanding tokenization is essential for improving LLM reliability and effective prompt engineering, as prompts may underperform if they fail to properly process certain concepts. The lecture also recommends using the "Tiktokenizer" as a useful tool for tokenization.
