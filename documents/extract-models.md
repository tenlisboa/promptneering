The document outlines a task for extracting model names from machine learning paper abstracts using a specific prompt format. The prompt instructs the user to return an array of model names in the format [\"model_name\"], or [\"NA\"] if no model names are found. An example abstract provided discusses Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4, and mentions the open-sourcing of models such as Chinese LLaMA and Alpaca. The prompt template is structured similarly, allowing for input abstracts to be processed. For further guidance, a reference to a Prompt Engineering Guide is included.
