AI agents, powered by large language models (LLMs), are transforming the execution of complex tasks by autonomously taking actions and solving problems. Unlike traditional LLMs, AI agents possess capabilities such as "planning and reflection," allowing them to analyze and adapt their strategies; "tool access," enabling interaction with external resources; and "memory," which helps them learn from past experiences. These features make AI agents particularly effective for tasks that require multiple steps and real-world information, such as "developing marketing strategies," "planning events," and "providing customer support." Common applications of AI agents include "recommendation systems," "customer support systems," "research," "e-commerce applications," "booking," "reporting," and "financial analysis," showcasing their versatility across various industries.
