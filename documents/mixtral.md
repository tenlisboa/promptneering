The Mixtral 8x7B model, developed by Mistral AI, is a Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) language model that utilizes 47 billion parameters but only activates 13 billion per token during inference, enhancing cost and latency efficiency. It excels in mathematical reasoning, code generation, and multilingual tasks, outperforming models like Llama 2 80B and GPT-3.5 on various benchmarks while using significantly fewer active parameters. The model can retrieve information effectively from a context window of 32k tokens, achieving 100% accuracy in specific retrieval tasks. Additionally, the Mixtral 8x7B Instruct model is fine-tuned for instruction following, ranking 8th on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard. For optimal prompting, users can employ the template ``[INST] instruction [/INST]``, and examples demonstrate its capabilities in generating JSON objects and Python code. The model also includes safety features to ensure respectful interactions.
