The document discusses a prompt designed to test an LLM's ability to identify hallucinations in closed-domain question answering, as suggested by Bubeck et al. (2023). The prompt provides patient facts about a 20-year-old female with a history of anorexia nervosa and depression, including her vital signs and denial of her illness. The task is to rewrite this information into a medical note, which GPT-4 successfully does, summarizing the patient's condition and risks. The final instruction is to verify that all claims in the medical note are supported by the provided patient facts and to report any discrepancies.
