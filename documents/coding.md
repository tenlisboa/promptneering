LLMs like ChatGPT are highly effective for code generation, particularly using the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model in OpenAI's Playground. By utilizing a `System Message`, you can define the model's behavior, such as instructing it to generate Python code without explanations. For instance, a prompt like ``"Write code that asks the user for their name and say 'Hello'"`` will yield a corresponding code block. Additionally, you can generate code from comments, as shown in the example with a prompt that outlines creating a list of movies and their ratings, resulting in a structured JSON object. The model can also complete functions, generate MySQL queries, and create database schemas and dummy data for testing. For example, a prompt like ``"Create a MySQL query for all students in the Computer Science department"`` produces a valid SQL query. Furthermore, you can ask the model to explain code, but be cautious with the System Message, as it may limit the model's responses. Overall, these capabilities make ChatGPT a valuable tool for developers.
