The text discusses the challenges and strategies for generating diverse synthetic datasets using large language models (LLMs) for tasks like legal document classification and children's story generation. It highlights the importance of dataset diversity to avoid repetition and ensure coherence, exemplified by a method where a vocabulary of 1500 basic words is used to create stories by randomly selecting verbs, nouns, and adjectives. An example prompt is provided: "Write a short story (3-5 paragraphs) which only uses very simple words that a 3 year old child would likely understand. The story should use the verb 'decorate', the noun 'thunder', and the adjective 'ancient'." The text also introduces iterative synthetic data generation, where initial prompts can be refined to create more complex outputs, and emphasizes the significance of high-quality training data, as demonstrated in the study by Gunasekar et al. (2023), which shows that training models on semi-synthetic datasets can yield effective results. The authors advocate for designing prompts with a target audience in mind to enhance diversity and suggest that fine-tuning on synthetic data is particularly beneficial for niche domains.
