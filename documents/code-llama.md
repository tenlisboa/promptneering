The Prompting Guide for Code Llama provides an overview of Code Llama, a family of large language models released by Meta, designed for code generation and discussion. It includes variants like Code Llama Python and Code Llama Instruct, available in sizes from 7B to 70B. The guide emphasizes effective prompting techniques for tasks such as code completion, debugging, and unit testing, using the Code Llama 70B Instruct model hosted by together.ai. For example, to generate a Fibonacci function, the prompt is structured as follows: ```python def generate_fibonacci(n): ...```. It also demonstrates debugging capabilities with prompts like ```python Where is the bug in this code? ...```, and unit test generation with prompts enclosed in tags. Additionally, it covers Text-to-SQL generation and few-shot prompting techniques, providing structured examples for each. The guide concludes with references for further exploration of Code Llama and its functionalities.
