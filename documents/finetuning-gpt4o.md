OpenAI has introduced fine-tuning capabilities for its GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini models, allowing developers to customize these models for specific applications, thereby enhancing performance. Developers can access the `GPT-4o-2024-08-06` checkpoint via the fine-tuning dashboard, enabling adjustments to response structure, tone, and adherence to complex instructions. The costs for fine-tuning are \$25 per million tokens for training and \$3.75 per million input tokens and \$15 per million output tokens for inference, available only to paid users. To promote experimentation, OpenAI is offering a limited-time promotion until September 23rd, providing 1 million free training tokens per day for GPT-4o and 2 million for GPT-4o mini. An example of fine-tuning includes training a model for emotion classification using a JSONL formatted dataset, which demonstrates significant accuracy improvements. After fine-tuning, developers can evaluate their models through the OpenAI playground or integrate them into applications via the OpenAI API for further testing.
