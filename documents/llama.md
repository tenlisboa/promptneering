The LLaMA paper introduces a series of foundation language models with parameters ranging from 7B to 65B, trained on trillions of tokens from publicly available datasets. It highlights that smaller models, when trained on more data, can outperform larger models, as evidenced by the recommendation to train 10B models on 200B tokens, while the 7B model's performance continues to improve even after 1T tokens. LLaMA models are designed to achieve optimal performance across various inference budgets, with LLaMA-13B outperforming GPT-3 (175B) despite being 10x smaller and capable of running on a single GPU, while LLaMA-65B competes with larger models like Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B.
