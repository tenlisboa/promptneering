Large language models (LLMs) have advanced significantly in recent years, demonstrating potential reasoning abilities when sufficiently scaled. Research, such as that by Sun et al. (2023), explores various reasoning tasks including mathematical, logical, and visual reasoning, and highlights techniques like alignment training and in-context learning. Reasoning in LLMs can be enhanced through various prompting approaches, categorized by Qiao et al. (2023) into reasoning enhanced strategies and knowledge enhancement reasoning, with methods like "Chain-of-Thought" and "Active-Prompt." Huang et al. (2023) further detail techniques for improving reasoning in models like GPT-3, including supervised fine-tuning and problem decomposition. However, there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs can genuinely reason and plan, with Subbarao Kambhampati (2024) suggesting that their capabilities may be more akin to universal approximate retrieval rather than true reasoning.
